# TileGame
A Java-based game engine I have been slowly adding features to since learning java during an Algorithmic Design course during the Spring of 2021.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was just to experiment with learning game development. I wanted to try to develop a simple 2D game engine in java to learn how basic features of games like in-game positioning and item inventory stystems work. 

## THIS PROJECT IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON
