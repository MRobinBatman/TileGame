# TileGame
A Java-based game engine I have been slowly adding features to since learning java during an Algorithmic Design course during the Spring of 2021.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was just to experiment with learning game development. I wanted to try to develop a simple 2D game engine in java to learn how basic features of games like in-game positioning and item inventory stystems work. 

## Project Takeaways
This project helped to cement the principles of obejct-oriented programming for me. The usefulness of inheritance, and using a tidy project structure was really explored during this project, as I created in-game classes that would inherit structural parts from other classes. I learned how to track in-game objects, how to load in objects useing tile-sheets, how to track movement using Euclidean distance and reference points, as well as how to deal with object collision. If I were to do anyhting different going forward, it would have to be standardizing the sizes of some of the  2D models I am using for in-game entities. It would help to simplify placing new objects onto the maps.

## Future Additions
In future changes, when I return to this project, I would like to add an in-game turn-based battle game mode. I would like to improve upon the in-game inventory, as well as add an aditional in-game menu so that you can save the game-state. I would also like to experiement with adding more maps, and adding NPCs in as well. It would be worth my time to also create a tool that would help me create the map files easier via a "click-and-drag" type interactive gui.
